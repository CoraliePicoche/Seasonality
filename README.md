# Seasonality
This repository contains the scripts and different versions of the paper entitled "How self-regulation, the storage effect and their interaction contribute to coexistence in stochastic and seasonal environments" (Picoche & Barraquand). This work builds on the model developed by Scranton & Vasseur (Theor  Ecol  9(3):353â€“363, 2016). The computer code in this repository implements their model and several variants, notably adding a seasonal forcing signal (in place of "white" noise) and strong self-regulation (in place of neutral competition).

This folder is organized as follow:
* in `article/`: first version and revised versions of the paper, as well as intermediate reports on the model.
* in `script/`: all scripts used in the paper (MATLAB). They are further described in the folder-specific README file.
* in `output_simulation/` : all simulations are output in .mat files which are described in 'whoswho.txt' and can be retrieved by contacting CP (coralie.picoche(at)u-bordeaux.fr)
