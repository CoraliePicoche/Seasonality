\caption{Temporal mean of biomass a function of the thermal optimum defining
each species. The temporal means are computed over the last 200 years
of a simulation spanning 5000 years. We considered both a white noise
(left) or a seasonal forcing signal (right). The coexistence mechanism
implemented is the storage effect, and no stabilizing niche differences
were considered (same inter- and intra-specific competition). This
simulation is the one described in Fig. 1
in main text\label{fig:Appendix_mean_biomass_iter2}. 99 other simulations
have been performed to produce the main text results in Figs. 2-4. }

\caption{Temporal mean biomass distribution, computed over the last 200 years,
for 9 representative simulations, as a function of the thermal optimum
of the species. These simulations are done without storage effect
but with strong self-regulation. Temperature is either a seasonal
signal (in red) or a random noise (in blue). The distribution induced
by a white noise forcing overlaps the one obtained with a seasonal
forcing signal in only 2 simulations out of 100, hence the two signals
lead in general to very different biomass distributions on the environmental
trait axis. \label{fig:Not_representative_behaviour} }
