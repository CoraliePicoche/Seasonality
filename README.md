# Seasonality
This repository contains the scripts and different versions of the paper entitled "How self-regulation, the storage effect and their interaction contribute to coexistence in stochastic and seasonal environments" (Picoche & Barraquand). This work is based on the model developped by Scranton & Vasseur (2016) in Theoretical Ecology. The same model is used to investigate the effect of a seasonal forcing signal and different coexistence mechanisms, namely the storage effect and strong self-regulation. 

This folder is organized as follow:
* in `article/`: first version and revised versions of the paper, as well as intermediate reports on the model.
* in `script/`: all scripts used in the paper (MATLAB). They are further described in the folder-specific README file.
* in `output_simulation/` : all simulations are output in .mat files which are described in 'whoswho.txt' and can be retrieved by contacting CP (coralie.picoche(at)u-bordeaux.fr)
