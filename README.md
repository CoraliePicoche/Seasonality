# Seasonality
This work is based on Scranton & Vasseur's 2016 paper (hereafter referred to as 'SV16') "Coexistence and emergent neutrality generate synchrony among competitors in fluctuating environments" in Theoretical Ecology. The same model is used to investigate the effect of a seasonal environmental forcing on the dynamics of the community (mostly in terms of coexistence). 
We have first aimed at reproducing the same results and figures as described in their paper, then used their model with a seasonal component and with different interaction matrices. The theoretical definition of the storage effect and its implementations are also discussed an modelled. 
This folder is organized as follow:
* in `Rapport/`: current report and bibliography, describing our first results and the graphe folder, containing all figures output. 
* in `script/`: all scripts (MATLAB). They are further described in the folder-specific README file.
* in `output_simulation/` : all simulations are output in .mat files which, for now, are not taken into account in the git folder. However, they are described in 'whoswho.txt' and can be retrieved by contacting CP. They will be saved with owncloud or git LFS later.
