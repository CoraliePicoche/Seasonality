\begin_layout Abstract
Explaining coexistence in species-rich communities of primary producers
 (e.g., tropical trees, phytoplankton) remains a challenge for ecologists
 because of the likely competition for shared basal resources.
 Following Hutchinson’s seminal suggestion, many theoreticians have tried
 to create diversity through a fluctuating environment, which impairs or
 slows down competitive exclusion.
 There are now several fluctuating-environment
\change_deleted -2100369821 1531131330
s
\change_unchanged
 models that allow coexistence, but they often produce only a dozen of coexistin
g species at best.
 Here, we investigate what it would take to create even richer communities
 in fluctuating environments using an empirically parameterized model.
 Building on the forced multi-species Lotka-Volterra model of Scranton and
 Vasseur (2016)
\change_inserted -2100369821 1531139653
 inspired by phytoplankton communities
\change_unchanged
, we have investigated the effect of two coexistence mechanisms, namely
 the storage effect and stabilizing niche differences (SNDs).
 SNDs occur when intraspecific competition is stronger than interspecific
 (as opposed to neutral models where competition is symmetric

), and we tuned the competition ratio based on empirical 
\change_deleted -2100369821 1531139672

\change_unchanged
data.
 Although SNDs maintained more species than the storage effect (50 % w.r.t
 25%), we show that none of the two coexistence mechanisms considered could,
 by itself, ensure the coexistence of all species present at the beginning
 of our simulations.
 Realistic seasonal environments only aggravated that picture, as they decreased
 persistence relative to white noise.
 Our results suggest that combining different mechanisms for biodiversity
 maintenance into community models might be more fruitful than trying to
 find which explains best the observed diversity levels.
 Our results on community composition (formation of clumps, biomass distribution
) in the different scenarios give further hints on how to empirically weight
 the influence of coexistence mechanisms.

Introduction

\begin_layout Standard
There has been a rich debate in theoretical ecology on how to reconcile
 niche and neutral perspectives on species coexistence 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "gravel_reconciling_2006,carmel_using_2017"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Under the neutral perspective, all species have equal birth and death rates
 and compete equally (for space) whilst under the niche perspective, birth
 and death rates can vary between species and various mechanisms contribute
 to increasing intraspecific over interspecific competition 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "hubbell_unified_2001"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 But as it has been pointed out repeatedly, niche and neutral processes
 are not mutually exclusive, and may actually act together to produce observed
 species coexistence

\begin_layout Standard
For instance, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "scheffer_self-organized_2006"

\end_inset

 put forward the concept of 'clumpy coexistence', whereby niche and neutral
 community assembly may be simultaneously at work, creating several clumps
 of similar species along a single trait axis.
 Classical stabilizing niche differences
\change_inserted -2100369821 1531140895
 (SNDs)
\change_unchanged
 enable coexistence of multiple clumps through stronger net intraspecific
 competition 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "chesson_mechanisms_2000"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, while within-clump coexistence occurs through neutral processes 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "hubbell_unified_2001,munoz_neutral_2016"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, as species that differ too little in their fitnesses cannot exclude themselves
 out on reasonable timeframes.
 Indeed, clumps on the trait axis eventually thin out in absence of immigration,
 but transient coexistence can last for extended periods of time.
 This 'emergent neutrality' within groups 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "holt_emergent_2006"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 has been proposed as a unifying concept for the niche and neutral theories.
 However, the findings of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "scheffer_self-organized_2006"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 have been disputed due to hidden niches in the original model 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "barabas_emergent_2013"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Hidden niches emerge through stronger intraspecific competition mediated
 by a an additional intraspecific predation-like term 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "barabas_emergent_2013"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 This makes coexistence in the Scheffer and van Nes model more similar to
 that of the classical Lotka-Volterra model 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "barabas_effect_2016"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, so that coexistence within clumps is not exactly neutral.
\change_inserted -1378791593 1528119834

\begin_layout Standard
Still, the idea that niche and neutral assembly can mould communities stays
 potent 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "vergnon_interpretation_2013"

\end_inset

.
 Since then, several studies have suggested that `clumpy coexistence' can
 occur in theoretical models, most notably models incorporating temporal
 variation

 In these temporal-variation models, equal competitive strengths are combined
 with other mechanisms like the storage effect
\change_inserted -2100369821 1531139961
 (or temporal niche partitioning, that is equivalent concepts for forced

 However,

 described temperature as a white noise, i.e.
 independent and identically distributed Gaussian random variates over time.
 This appeared to us as a key assumption to relax.
 Under most latitudes, temperature is indeed a seasonal signal, and seasonal
 forcing can strongly affect the dynamics of the community considered

 Over short timescales, random temporal variation

 Our present work can therefore be seen as an attempt to blend

Because many phytoplankton species or genera respond in similar ways to
 temperature despite having different optimas

ized that a large seasonal variation might not necessarily foster species
 coexistence.
 In fact, similar responses to seasonal fluctuations should lead to an increased
 synchrony of species abundances which, in turn, should theoretically mitigate
 the expected temporal partitioning.
 How seasonality affects coexistence (as opposed to a purely randomly fluctuatin
g environment) is therefore a key feature of this paper.
 In particular, we contrast cases where the storage effect is present vs.
 absent, which conveniently maps to two different parameterizations of the
 forced Lotka-Volterra model.
 Moreover, we realized while running 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

's model that the overall diversity obtained 
\change_deleted -2100369821 1531139998

\change_inserted -2100369821 1531140006
at the end of the simulations
\change_unchanged
 was relatively low compared to what we usually observe in phytoplankton
 communities (several dozens to hundreds of species).
 We have therefore sought out which mechanisms

In an empirical study combining phytoplankton community-level time series
 and multivariate autoregressive models

, we found that despite a large influence of the environment (including
 temperature, irradiance, and other factors), intraspecific (or intragenus)
 competition was
\change_deleted -2100369821 1531140064
 rather large and 
\change_unchanged
most likely the key driver of species coexistence.
 In other words, stabilizing niche differences had a large role to play
 in maintaining species diversity in coastal phytoplankton

 This led us to cross different combinations of seasonality in the forcing
 signal, presence of the storage effect or not, and intra- vs interspecific

They go from -1.8°C to 30°C, so the temperature range here is slightly more
 constrained.
 I'm wondering to which extent another - narrower - range should be considered
 to get closer to empirical environmental fluctuations.
 Not sure it is necessary to address this right away, but it might arise
 in reviewers' comments.

\change_inserted -2100369821 1530869066
 Here, when considering all seasonal simulations, temperatures range from
 2.4°C to 36.5°C : it's an even larger range! I'm wondering if we really need

 If we take the average ocean depth around 3.7 km, it gives use between 80
 and 280 gC m^-2 (compared to about 800 kgC/area !).
 If we consider a hypertrophic lake (500-2500 mgC.m^-3) and a *very* deep
 lake (around 1000m), we have a maximum of 2.5 kgC.m^-2 (still 100 times lower).

\begin_layout Standard
We have simulated competitive Lotka-Volterra dynamics forced by a fluctuating
 environment (e.g., temperature fluctuations) under a range of scenarios allowing
 more or less coexistence.
 Two coexistence mechanisms, the storage effect and stabilizing niches differenc
es, could be either present or absent, which led to four scenarios.
 These four scenarios were crossed with two possibilities for the forcing
 signal, a white noise and a stochastic yet seasonal signal, both with equal
 temporal variance.
 Our investigation therefore built on the model of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "scranton_coexistence_2016"

\end_inset

, which included a white noise forcing and a storage effect, but considered
 seven additional combinations of mechanisms.
 This was motivated by our wish to include two observed features of phytoplankto
n dynamics: seasonal cycles 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 and stabilizing niche differences

We have found that first, forced Lotka-Volterra dynamics cannot sustain

 A nice point made by

 On their own, SNDs produced a higher level of diversity than the storage
 effect (almost double for white noise)
\change_inserted -2100369821 1531141373

However, the seasonal forcing still considerably reduced diversity when
 SNDs were considered, especially the

\end_inset

 kind of diversity, i.e., diversity within clumps of similar traits.
 This diversity reduction occurs because within a season, the signal autocorrela
tion gives long, contiguous

 to the best competitor to exclude its less adapted heterospecifics, while
 
\change_inserted -2100369821 1531141386
a 
\change_unchanged
white noise generates large temperature shifts more frequently, and thereby
 forbid such competitive exclusion.
 In a seasonal setting, even though a species has the best long-term averaged
 growth rate, it can disappear as a result of a strong competition from
 both low- and high-temperature tolerant species, with and without storage
 effect.

Our results may appear at odds with recent proposals that seasonal forcing
 in itself would help maintain diversity

 However, we compared the effect of seasonal forcing to that of other forcing
 signals while controlling total variance.
 Thus, the contrast between our results and those of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "sakavara_lumpy_2018"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 may be due to the role of forcing variance over time.
 Overall, seasonality may be slightly better than no forcing at all in maintaini
ng diversity, but on its own, seasonal forcing of parameters does little
 to improve coexistence and it does not really foster diversity within clumps
 here.

\begin_layout Standard
In our previous empirical study of coastal phytoplankton dynamics 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "barraquand_weak_2017"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, we have not found any storage effect (which certainly does not mean that
 it could not be observed in other systems).
 Given the results on species richness and composition presented here, we
 are skeptical that even if it was present, the storage effect alone could
 help explaining phytoplankton diversity.
 This is all the more likely that SNDs seem fairly strong when estimated
 from phytoplankton time series 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "barraquand_weak_2017"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 However, our results suggest that in phytoplankton-like seasonal environments,
 even though empirically-based SNDs produce more diversity than the storage
 effect when considered in isolation, the storage effect can help diversity
 maintenance when combined to other mechanisms.
 Indeed, the combination storage effect + SNDs is non-additive: the cases
 were both SNDs and the storage effect were present showed more diversity
 than generated by any mechanism on its own.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above results suggest the very exciting idea that multiple coexistence
 mechanisms might combine superadditively, thus helping us to better understand
 the astounding diversity of primary producers.
 This logic could, in principle, be extended to mechanisms that we have
 not considered here (e.g., spatial structure, specialized natural enemies,
 that could be as important here for plankton as they are for tropical trees

).
 Previous research has however demonstrated that generalist seed predation
 could weaken the storage effect 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "kuang_coexistence_2009,kuang_interacting_2010"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 thus different mechanisms might not always combine superadditively as we
 found here.
 That said, other models have shown that pathogens could enhance the storage
 effect 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "mordecai_pathogen_2015"

 or that equalizing mechanisms due to optimally foraging predators are not
 greatly affected by environmental variation

.
 Better explaining plant or microbial diversity would then not be about
 selecting the best unique mechanism susceptible to explain the observed
 diversity, but rather better combining those mechanisms together.
 This may obviously be an annoyance for those who like to sharpen Occam's
 razor, but it clearly holds opportunities for theoreticians wishing to
 investigate synergies between coexistence mechanisms in highly diverse
 communities.
 Aside from the synergies between predator diversity-enhancing effects and
 SNDs or storage effects (on the temporal axis), one obvious follow-up of
 this research would be interactions with spatial structure.
 Spatial structure occurs both endogeneously, through spatially restricted
 movements and interactions, and exogeneously, through spatial variation
 in environmental covariates

 small-scale spatial structure - can help coexistence, which we believe
 would be especially important for phytoplankton since many species form
 colonies (

 Moreover, although temperature is usually relatively spatially homogeneous
 over space, other drivers (e.g., rainfall, pH in terrestrial ecosystems;
 salinity in aquatic ones) may exhibit spatial variation which is a main
 factor for coexistence

 The odds that different (resource) niches, natural enemies, spatial limits
 to competition and temporal niche partitioning all interact to promote
 the very high-dimensional coexistence observed in the field seem much higher
 than for any of those mechanisms alone.
 Whether the diversity-enhancing effects of these mechanisms combine sub-additiv
ely (as in
