\begin_layout Abstract
Explaining coexistence in species-rich communities of primary producers
 remains a challenge for ecologists because of the likely competition for
 shared resources.
 Following Hutchinson’s seminal suggestion, many theoreticians have tried
 to create diversity through a fluctuating environment, which impairs or
 slows down competitive exclusion.
 There are now several fluctuating-environment models allowing coexistence,
 but they often produce only a dozen of coexisting species at best.
 Here, we investigate how to create even richer communities in fluctuating
 environments, using an empirically parameterized model.
 Building on the forced Lotka-Volterra model of Scranton and Vasseur (2016)
 inspired by phytoplankton communities, we have investigated the effect
 of two coexistence mechanisms, namely the storage effect and

\change_inserted -2100369821 1538649806
.
 We tuned the competition ratio on empirical data, in which self-regulation

\change_unchanged
 maintained more species (50%) than the storage effect (25%), we show that
 none of the two coexistence mechanisms considered could, by itself, ensure
 the coexistence of all species present at the beginning of our simulations.
 Realistic seasonal environments only aggravated that picture, as they decreased
 persistence relative to

 Our results suggest that combining different mechanisms for biodiversity
 maintenance into community models might be more fruitful than trying to
 find which mechanism explains best the observed diversity levels.
 Our results on community composition (formation of clumps, biomass distribution
) in the different scenarios give further hints about likely coexistence
 mechanisms at work.

Introduction

\begin_layout Standard
There has been a rich debate in theoretical ecology on how to reconcile
 niche and neutral perspectives on species coexistence

\end_inset

.
 Under the neutral perspective, all species have equal birth and death rates
 and compete equally (since space is limited) whilst under the niche perspective
, birth and death rates can vary between species and various mechanisms
 contribute to increasing intraspecific over interspecific competition 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 However, as it has been pointed out repeatedly, niche and neutral processes
 are not mutually exclusive: they may actually act together to produce observed
 species coexistence

\change_deleted -666822487 1539178436
 put forward the concept of `clumpy coexistence'
\change_unchanged
, whereby a simultaneous influence of both niche and neutral processes create
 several clumps of similar species along a single trait axis.

\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "hubbell_unified_2001,munoz_neutral_2016"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, as species that differ too little in their fitnesses cannot exclude themselves
 out on reasonable timeframes.
 Indeed, clumps on the trait axis eventually thin out in absence of immigration,
 but transient coexistence can last for extended periods of time.
 This `emergent neutrality' within groups 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "holt_emergent_2006"

\end_inset

 has been proposed as a unifying concept for the niche and neutral theories.
 The findings of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

 have been disputed due to hidden niches in the original model 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "barabas_emergent_2013"

 Hidden niches emerge through stronger intraspecific competition mediated
 by a an additional intraspecific predation-like term 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "barabas_emergent_2013"

\end_inset

 This makes coexistence in the Scheffer and van Nes model more similar to
 that of the classical Lotka-Volterra model 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "barabas_effect_2016"

 Still, the idea that niche and neutral assembly can mould communities stays
 potent 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "vergnon_interpretation_2013"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Since then, several studies have suggested that `clumpy coexistence' can
 occur in theoretical models, most notably models incorporating temporal
 variation

LatexCommand citep
key "scranton_coexistence_2016,sakavara_lumpy_2018"

\end_inset

.
 In these temporal-variation models, equal competitive strengths are combined
 with other mechanisms like the storage effect (or temporal niche partitioning,
 that is an equivalent concept for forced Lotka-Volterra models, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "barabas_community_2012,scranton_coexistence_2016"

\end_inset

).
 The storage effect increases the possibility of coexistence by making the
 interaction strength covary positively with a fluctuating environment (see
 also 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

).

\begin_layout Standard
Here, we build on the work of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 to investigate the possibility of coexistence through species response
 to fluctuating environments.
 Our enthusiasm for the 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 their thermal preference curves modeling intrinsic growth rates.
 However,

temperature as a random noise, i.e., independent and identically distributed
 Gaussian random variates over time.
 This appeared to us a key assumption to relax.
 Under most latitudes, temperature is indeed a seasonal signal, and seasonal
 forcing can strongly affect the dynamics of the community considered 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "vesipa_impact_2017"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Hence, over short timescales, random temporal variations often only add
 noise to a largely deterministic seasonal trend.
 Our present work can therefore be seen as an attempt to blend 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "scranton_coexistence_2016"

\end_inset

's framework with the periodic environments of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

, to better represent the mixture of stochastic and deterministic environmental
 forces affecting phytoplankton community dynamics.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because many phytoplankton species or genera respond in similar ways to
 temperature despite having different optimas 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "moisan_modelling_2002"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, we hypothesized that a large seasonal variation might not necessarily
 foster species coexistence.
 In fact, similar responses to seasonal fluctuations should lead to an increased
 synchrony of species abundances which, in turn, should theoretically mitigate
 the expected temporal partitioning.
 How seasonality affects coexistence (as opposed to a purely randomly fluctuatin
g environment) is therefore a key feature of this paper.
 In particular, we contrast cases where the storage effect is present vs.
 absent, which conveniently maps to two different parameterizations of the
 forced Lotka-Volterra model.
 Moreover, the overall diversity obtained at the end of the simulations
 with 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "scranton_coexistence_2016"
literal "false"

\end_inset

's model was relatively low compared to what we usually observe in phytoplankton
 communities (several dozens to hundreds of species).
 We have therefore sought out which mechanisms would foster a truly species-rich
 community for extended periods of time.

Here, we therefore try to establish what are the relative contributions
 of the storage effect vs strong self-regulation to coexistence in a phytoplankt
on-like theoretical community model.
 This led us to cross different combinations of seasonality in the forcing
 signal, presence of the storage effect or not, and intra- vs interspecific
 competition, in order to disentangle the contributions of all these factors
 to biodiversity maintenance.

 All persisting species in the random noise simulations were clustered within
 a 3.2°C-range of thermal optima (see the biomass distribution as a function

 No obvious temporal patterns (e.g., cycles) could be seen in the communities

 When temperatures are high, the group with higher thermal optima reaches
 its maximum biomass, then as temperature decreases through the season,
 these species leave room for the growth of the low-temperature group.

Both a strong self-regulation and the storage effect markedly increased

 Without any of these coexistence mechanisms, only one species persisted

 Remarkably, when the storage effect and a strong self-regulation both affected

 Without storage effect nor strong self-regulation, there was only one species

 A random noise favored species with intermediate thermal optima: the final

 the initial range of thermal optima) for two simulation out of three and
 the maximum final biomasses over 100 simulations was reached in this range(Fig.

 The forcing signal modified only the distribution of biomasses resulting
 in contrasted community structures despite equal richness in both simulation
 types.
 With a random noise, the distribution was unimodal with a maximum biomass
 reached for the second best long-term average growth rate (corresponding
 to a thermal optimum of 20.2°C).
 On the contrary, a seasonal signal led to a bi-modal distribution (centered
 on 17.0°C and 24.4°C), each corresponding to one season, with highest biomasses
 for higher thermal optima (Fig.

This last part has to be better explained or suppressed (if not essential):
 it is really hard to understand – perhaps you mean that if we ranked the
 species by order of maximum biomass, then the last biomass rank (min biomass)
 in the seasonal case would equal the second rank in the random noise case.
 Not sure that it is easy to get that.

In cases where the richness of the community varied, the overall shape (multimod

 unimodal) of the marginal distribution of extant species with respect to
 the trait axis were similar for both types of environmental forcings (Fig.

).
 By contrast, the type of coexistence mechanism generated different shapes.
 Indeed, the storage effect led to a multimodal biomass distribution with
 respect to thermal optima.
 We always observed 3 modes with a random noise and 3 modes in 95% of the
 seasonal simulations (Fig.

a).
 With a random noise, extant species are grouped in rather similar clumps
 regarding species thermal optima (between 18.8°C and 22.2°C) whereas clumps
 tended to be further apart in the seasonal case, covering a total range
 of 7.7°C, with species grouping in the higher part of the thermal range,
 above 22°C.
 On the other hand, strong self-regulation led to a quasi-uniform biomass
 distribution (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 b).
 Species characterising communities forced by a random noise stayed in the
 lower range of temperatures (in 96% of the simulations, the highest thermal
 optimum was 22.4°C, see Fig.
 A2 in the Supplementary Material) while they were filtered out in communities
 subjected to a seasonal fluctuation of their environment, for which species
 with thermal optima above 20.5°C persisted.
 As before (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 the autocorrelated temperatures enabled them to achieve this highest growth
 rate for a longer period of time than a random noise would have.

We have simulated competitive Lotka-Volterra dynamics forced by a fluctuating
 environment (e.g., temperature fluctuations) under a range of scenarios allowing
 more or less coexistence.

\change_inserted -666822487 1539019839

, could be either present or absent, which led to four scenarios.
 These four scenarios were crossed with two possibilities for the forcing
 signal, a random noise (mostly white) and a stochastic yet seasonal signal,
 both with equal temporal variance.
 Our investigation therefore built on the model of

Before discussing the ecological interpretation of our results, we first
 recall some technical assumptions made in this study.
 All our simulations relied upon the 5000 timesteps for numerical integration
 that were also used by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "scranton_coexistence_2016"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 This means that short- and medium-term transients (a few years to hundreds
 of years) are completely negligible at the end of the time series, but
 very long transients can remain.
 We realized that convergence could in some cases be incomplete after 5000
 years (e.g., random noise + storage effect + equal competitive strength).
 These would not even be stabilized well after 10 000 years, they would
 take ~ 15 000 years and the rate of convergence would slow over time.
 We kept a fixed time integration window rather than waiting for convergence
 for both technical and ecological reasons.
 From a technical standpoint, adding 10 000 years of numerical integration
 for the sake of reaching the equilibrium would have been very computationally
 challenging, and comparison with the values reported by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "scranton_coexistence_2016"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 would have been compromised.
 From an ecological standpoint, waiting for full convergence when there
 are extremely long transients (Hastings et al.
 2018) is also quite artificial: there is no reason to believe that very
 long transients (i.e., one that maintains for thousands of year) has any
 less ecological reality than an attractor that is deemed stable because
 convergence has been reached.
 Speed of convergence is therefore an issue to judge whether transients
 should be considered or excluded, and very long yet fixed time window for
 integration allows advantageously to compare mechanisms for which speed
 of convergence might differ.

 the structure is geared to include either a storage effect or a strong

 Although this absence of diversity-enhancing effect of

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "fox_intermediate_2013"

\end_inset

, so we feel compelled to stress it once more: temporal variation in growth
 rate alone cannot help coexistence within competitive communities.
 A nice point made by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "scranton_coexistence_2016"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 was that a built-in storage effect in a forced Lotka-Volterra model, parameteri
zed for phytoplankton communities, could lead to some degree of coexistence.
 Our investigation reproduced these results, using the random noise considered
 by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "scranton_coexistence_2016"

\end_inset

.
 However, an arguably more lifelike noisy and seasonal temperature forcing
 considerably lessened the richness of the community after 5000 years, decreasin
g from 15 to 4 species on average.
 Even imagining that groups represented here are genera or classes rather
 than species, this is a fairly low diversity for a phytoplankton-like community
 (see Chapter 1 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "reynolds2006ecology"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 This suggests that the storage effect may not, on its own, be sufficient
 to maintain species-rich communities (e.g., dozens to hundreds of species).
 We have therefore sought out whether a stronger self-regulation could maintain
 a higher diversity, using field-based intra- vs intergroup (species or
 genera) competition strength ratio 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 strong self-reguation, depends on the intensity of self-regulation of each

Still, the widespread effects of natural enemies in phytoplankton (zooplankton,
 parasites) may contribute to increase the strength of self-regulation (Gaedke

 However, we compared the effect of seasonal forcing to that of other forcing

 Thus, the contrast between our results and those of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 may be due to the role of forcing variance over time (we compare scenarios
 under a constant total variance).
 Overall, while seasonality may be slightly better than no forcing at all
 in maintaining diversity, seasonal forcing of parameters does not improve
 coexistence: diversity within clumps is lower when seasonality is included.

In addition to community diversity, the biomass-trait relationship also
 varied from one simulation to another.

 convincingly argued that multimodality could arise from the demographic
 stochasticity of a single model run (with either self-regulation or neutrality,
 but without the clumpy coexistence emerging from a storage effect).
 However, our results are based on many model runs, for which either the
 storage effect alone or a storage effect + strong self-regulation in a
 seasonal context consistently produced multimodal distributions, while
 simulations without the storage effect always led to a single cluster along
 the trait axis.
 Our suggestion for empirical studies is as follows: if only one spatial
 location is observed, caution in interpreting multiple clumps on the trait
 axis is of course required, as

 highlighted.
 However, with several locations - or in a theoretical context - one could
 average across locations to reproduce similar graphs to the ones produced
 here.
 Clumps in the trait axis when averaged across model runs/locations is therefore
 a signature of the storage effect for the cases that we considered in the
 article.
 Of course, other mechanisms that we did not include in our models may produce
 similar patterns

 could help explaining phytoplankton diversity.
 However, our results suggest that in phytoplankton-like seasonal environments,
 even though empirically-based self-regulation produce much more diversity
 than the storage effect when considered in isolation, the storage effect
 can help diversity maintenance when combined to other mechanisms.
 Indeed, the combination storage effect + strong self-regulation is non-additive
: the cases were both self-regulation and the storage effect were present
 showed more diversity than generated by any mechanism on its own.

The above results suggest the very exciting idea that multiple coexistence
 mechanisms might combine superadditively, thus helping us to better understand
 the astounding diversity of primary producers.
 This logic could, in principle, be extended to mechanisms that we have
 not considered here (e.g., spatial structure, specialized natural enemies,
 that could be as important here for plankton as they are for tropical trees,

I'm not sure for Stump and Chesson 2015 -> They show that there is only
 little effect of the interaction between mechanisms.
 OK, I deleted.

 Previous research has however demonstrated that generalist seed predation
 could weaken the storage effect

 thus different mechanisms might not always combine superadditively as we
 found here.
 That said, superadditivity has been found in some cases, i.e., pathogens
 could enhance the storage effect

 Better explaining plant or microbial diversity would then not be about
 selecting the best unique mechanism susceptible to explain the observed
 diversity, but rather better combining those mechanisms together.
 This may obviously be an annoyance for those who like to sharpen Occam's
 razor, but it clearly holds opportunities for theoreticians wishing to
 investigate synergies between coexistence mechanisms in highly diverse
 communities.
 Aside from the synergies between predator diversity-enhancing effects

 storage effects (on the temporal axis), one obvious follow-up of this research
 would be interactions with spatial structure.
 Spatial structure occurs both endogeneously, through spatially restricted
 movements and interactions, and exogeneously, through spatial variation
 in environmental covariates

 Numerous studies 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 have shown that spatially restricted movements and interactions - very
 small-scale spatial structure - can help coexistence, which we believe
 would be especially important for phytoplankton since many species form
 colonies (

).
 Moreover, although temperature is usually relatively spatially homogeneous
 over space, other drivers (e.g., rainfall, pH in terrestrial ecosystems;
 salinity in aquatic ones) may exhibit spatial variation which is a main
 factor for coexistence

 The odds that different (resource) niches, natural enemies, spatial limits
 to competition and temporal niche partitioning all interact to promote
 the very high-dimensional coexistence observed in the field seem much higher
 than for any of those mechanisms alone.
 Whether the diversity-enhancing effects of these mechanisms combine sub-additiv
ely (as in
