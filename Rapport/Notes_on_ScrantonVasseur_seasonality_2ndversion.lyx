 devised a model to investigate what maintains the diversity of competitors
 in a fluctuating environment.
 Their model is loosely based on the dynamics of phytoplankton, and corresponds
 for the most part to how we (and many others) think such dynamics can play
 out.
 For instance, nutrients do not necessarily have strong forcing effects
 but other abiotic drivers may impose a synchronous forcing, including most
 notably irradiance and temperature.
 Their model, which includes thermal preference curves, is also relatively
 simple in terms of parameterization, which attracted our interest.

Stabilizing differences for coexistence occur here through a built-in storage
 effect (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

We find that competitors with sufficiently different temperature niches
 coexist via temporal niche differentiation

\end_inset

)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Equalizing differences between similar competitors presumably maintain near-neut
ral dynamics within clumps, because the thermal curves of the various species
 are (i) similar enough and (ii) environmental variability forbids that
 a clump of competitors maintains itself in good conditions long enough
 that exclusion could occur.

Near neutrality results in interspecific synchrony within the groups of
 similar competitors

We've been puzzled by several elements, largely inspired by our phytoplankton
 work (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "barraquand_weak_2017"
literal "true"

\end_inset

):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The forcing signal, aka temperature, is strongly random (white noise) here,
 whilst it is rather seasonal.
 Would the same results hold in a seasonal environment, where similar species
 can potentially compete over a longer time period (because the season can
 be long compared to the timeframe of plankton generation).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
What's the role of the built-in storage effect there? Are coexistence and
 a fluctuating environment necessarily linked, as suggested by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 who equate it with temporal niche differentiation?

 Are the patterns of species synchrony in this model (and in seasonal variants
 thereof) similar to what we see in the field?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have therefore aimed at reproducing the model and produce new variants
 to test these questions and better understand phytoplankton-like communities,
 that live in fairly seasonal environments.

A: I'm puzzled by this expression.
 Since all 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{ij}$
\end_inset

 are the same, it is pretty much the relative values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{ij}$
\end_inset

 which matter.
 However, since these are correlation coefficients - which vary between
 -1 and 1, they could actually cancel each other out when summed.
 I wonder whether this metric couldn't obscure that some species are synchronise
d with some, but asynchronised with others.
 What do you think? C : There was a mistake in the report (not the code):
 each correlation coefficient is weighted by the standard deviation of the
 competitor 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

.
 I corrected it.
 However, it does not change your point: this metric is indeed close to
 0 for a species which would be synchronized with the same number of species
 it would compensate (if all species have the same standard deviation).
 This is an information in itself (which I have a hard time interpreting
 for now, I must admit), but should be supplemented by other metrics.
 I think indices based on variance ratio for the whole community would be
 interesting (

 As described in the original paper, when the system is dominated by seasonal
 dynamics, species form three clumps within the [19-22]°C interval and show
 small or negative values of synchrony.
 When temperatures are different for every species, less species survive,
 with more homogeneous abundances and no patterns of synchrony.

 absolute values remaining low when compared with previous simulations with
 the same interaction coefficients.
 Results are similar for all simulations: synchrony values remain between
 -0.01 and 0.01 and mean biomass does not exceed 10 for any species, but does
 not fall below 2.
 The most striking features of these simulations is the persistence of all
 species, with lower average biomass and no clumps formed.
 It seems that increasing the competition within groups lead to a more even

 This factor is only implicit in Chesson's formalism.
 Provided the periodicity of the environment remains constant and the dynamics
 of the environment variables are fast compared to population dynamics,they

 This formulation does not rely on the small-fluctuation approach, contrary

In this case, competition and growth do not covary.
 Such a model is built on the hypothesis that changes in effective competition
 only depend on species densities which respond to the temporal forcing
 embedded in the intrinsic growth rates.

A: However, I think the relevance of this model depends on which type of
 competition we consider.
 In the case of exploitative competition, this mass-action effect doesn't
 account for the amount of resources on which consumers feed.
 A constant 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{j}$
\end_inset

 could also be read as reflecting a constant amount of resources which doesn't
 match the changes in 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{in}(\tau)$
\end_inset

.
 In the case of interference competition, this implementation would make
 more sense.
 An increase in resource abundance supports more consumers, and their competitio
n will increase only because they interact more directly by preventing each
 other's consumption of the same resource.
 In this case, the amount of available resource is not the cause of competition,
 but the density of competitors.
 Well...
 I guess that can still depend on whether the resource is rare.
 So I'm not a big fan of this phenomenological implementation of seasonality.

 This also seems to be the case in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 who considered only seasonal forcing in resources' abundances (at least,
 growth rates and resources do not covary explicitly).
 However, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

 consider a mechanistic model of competition with two resources shared by
 many consummers so any comparison is for now tentative.
 Indeed, they explicit the dynamics of resources which only the growth rates
 embed some seasonal variability.

We should therefore check if the persistence and dynamics of the species
 are affected by the deletion of an explicit storage effect in the LV model.
 We want to check if we still observe clumps and a few remaining species
 when the temporal partitioning of the niche, due to the storage effect,
 is removed from the model.

For future work: the number of species could be increased to make the proportion
 of extant species more relevant.
 In this case, if we don't want to increase the niche overlap, and therefore
 the competition, we should decrease B, the niche breadth.
 This would mean that we have more specialist species.
 We could also allow species to have different B so as to consider communities
 with various distributions of niche breadths and see the effect on persistence.

A: To me, this depends very much on what we consider to be the cause of
 species competition.
 To my understanding, this study focuses on the effect of a seasonal environment
 on species coexistence.
 In the model, this seasonal environment affects directly and differentially
 the intrinsic growth rates and competition rates of species because of
 their various thermal optima.
 This may be personal taste, but my feeling is that introducing variables
 values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{ij}$
\end_inset

would generate more variability in the results and blurr what is due to
 seasonality and thermal optimum.
 Another way to consider this matter would be to answer the question

Time spent in the most important functions of the code.
 We used comm assembly to check if the interruption in the integration was
 time consuming.

In the ode integration function, 50% of the time is required only to load
 growth data ; 14% for the competition computation and 12% for the final
 computation : growth + competition.
 Initializing temperature and maximum growth rates in the main program is
 therefore time expensive but I don't really see how to do it differently
 if we want to save stochastic temperatures ; and I'm not sure computing
 maxium possible growth rates for each time step would be more effective.
 Should be tried, though

Tried: time spent on SV16 integration was 50% higher.
 My first implementation was the best one so far.

We could also save b computation for once and load it, but this means we
 decide once and for all which species we use (and reduce the range considered
 by S&V, and/or increase the precision in the right range to increase the
 total number of species).

 use 5000 time steps as the necessary time for the model to stabilize.
 However, we can expect the model to stabilize more quickly with seasonality
 (this will be a necessary check before lauching simulations)

In addition to the time cost, species invasion or removal requires the introduct
ion of discontinuities in the dynamics of the community.
 This can be done in 3 ways using Matlab: using the event function (but
 events do not depend on the dynamics of the community, so are not really
 appropriate for this), integrating on segments of the total time span,
 stopping for every species addition or deletion (our choice, until now

A: I think this is a the neatest, because of discontinuities as you underline
 it.
\end_layout

), or introducing the species for a given time without stopping the simulation
 (which would require the model to test each time step and compare it to
 the invasion or removal time sequence set in the main program: this is
 too expensive for what we want).
