\begin_layout Abstract
Explaining coexistence in species-rich communities of primary producers
 remains a challenge for ecologists because of their likely competition
 for shared resources.
 Following Hutchinson’s seminal suggestion, many theoreticians have tried
 to create diversity through a fluctuating environment, which impairs or
 slows down competitive exclusion.
 However, fluctuating-environment models often only produce a dozen of coexistin
g species at best.
 Here, we investigate how to create richer communities in fluctuating environmen
ts, using an empirically parameterized model.
 Building on the forced Lotka-Volterra model of Scranton and Vasseur (2016),
 inspired by phytoplankton communities, we have investigated the effect
 of two coexistence mechanisms, namely the storage effect and higher intra-
 than interspecific competition strengths (i.e., strong self-regulation).
 We tuned the intra/inter competition ratio based on empirical analyses,
 in which self-regulation dominates interspecific interactions.
 Although a strong self-regulation maintained more species (50%) than the
 storage effect (25%), we show that none of the two coexistence mechanisms
 considered could ensure the coexistence of all species alone.
 Realistic seasonal environments only aggravated that picture, as they decreased
 persistence relative to a random environment.
 However, strong self-regulation and the storage effect combined superadditively
 so that all species could persist with both mechanisms at work.
 Our results suggest that combining different coexistence mechanisms into
 community models might be more fruitful than trying to find which mechanism
 best explains diversity.
 We additionally highlight that while biomass-trait distributions provide
 some clues regarding coexistence mechanisms, they cannot indicate unequivocally
 which mechanisms are at play.

Introduction

\begin_layout Standard
The continued maintenance of diversity in spite of widespread competition
 has long bewildered ecologists, especially for primary producers such as
 phytoplankton that share the same basic resources

.
 A solution for the `paradox of the plankon' was proposed by Hutchinson:
 temporal variation of the environment.
 By making the identity of the fittest species change over time, temporal
 variation could render competitive exclusion less likely, which was confirmed
 by early experiments

 However, it has been shown later that inclusion of temporal variability

 in competition models is not sufficient for maintaining a realistic diversity

 Additional mechanisms such as the storage effect

 Moreover, richness rarely exceeds a handful to a dozen of species in model
 competitive communities in fluctuating environments, except when external
 inputs from immigration sustain diversity

 of 2 to 3 species

 In this model, the synchronizing effect of the environment and the storage

 described daily temperature as a random noise, i.e., independent and identically
 distributed Gaussian random variates over time.
 However, under most latitudes, seasonality drives part of the environmental
 variation: over short timescales, random temporal variations often only
 add noise to a largely deterministic seasonal trend

Seasonal forcing of parameters can strongly affect the dynamics of model
 communities by synchronizing species to the seasonal signal or even promoting

 How seasonality affects coexistence, as opposed to a randomly fluctuating
 environment, is therefore a key feature of this paper.
 Our present work can be seen as an attempt to blend

's stochastic framework with the periodic environments of

 forces affecting phytoplankton community dynamics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What other key features of field communities should be considered when modeling
 phytoplankton? Strong self-regulation, with intraspecific competition much
 stronger than interspecific interactions, has been found to be widespread
 in terrestrial plant communities 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "adler_competition_2018"

\end_inset

, animal communities 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, and phytoplanktonic communities 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "barraquand2018coastal"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 We will therefore insert those niche differences, manifesting as strong
 self-regulation, into our models of phytoplankton competition.
 The interaction between environment variability and niche overlap was investiga
ted by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "abrams_niche_1976"

 but his results did not extend to communities more diverse than 4 species;
 our objective is therefore to see how those mechanisms interact for species-ric
h communities.

\begin_layout Standard
Niche models have often been opposed to the neutral theory 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "hubbell_unified_2001"

\end_inset

, where dispersal and drift can ensure a transient coexistence of many species,
 but several authors have attempted to blend niche and neutral processes
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gravel_reconciling_2006,scheffer_self-organized_2006,carmel_using_2017"

 An intriguing offshoot of these attempts is the concept of `clumpy coexistence'
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "scheffer_self-organized_2006"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, whereby simultaneous influences of both niche and neutral processes create
 several clumps of similar species along a single trait axis.
 Niche differences enable coexistence of multiple clumps 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "chesson_mechanisms_2000"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 while within-clump coexistence occurs through neutral processes.
 This `emergent neutrality' within groups 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "holt_emergent_2006"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 has been proposed as a unifying concept for niche and neutral theories
 (even though the neutrality of the original model has been disputed due
 to hidden niches, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "barabas_emergent_2013"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Since then, clumpy coexistence has been shown to occur in theoretical models
 incorporating a temporally variable environment interacting with a thermal
 preference trait axis

 The relationship (or absence thereof) between biomass-trait distributions
 and coexistence mechanisms is currently debated 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 may be a robust find

\begin_layout Standard
Here, we try to establish what are the relative contributions to coexistence
 of the storage effect vs strong self-regulation, in a phytoplankton-like
 theoretical community model with a large number of species.
 This led us to cross combinations of seasonality vs randomness in the forcing
 signal, presence of the storage effect or not, and intra- vs interspecific
 competition intensity, in order to disentangle the contributions of these
 factors to biodiversity maintenance and their potential interactions.
 Alongside the resulting species richness, we also report which biomass-trait
 distribution can be expected under a given combination of processes leading
 to coexistence.

\begin_layout Standard
The original environmental forcing is a normally distributed variable centered
 on 293 K (20°C), with a 5 K dispersion.
 Temperature varies from one day to the next, but is kept constant throughout
 the day.
 At and above the daily scale, temperature could therefore be considered
 as a white noise 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "vasseur_color_2004"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 However, from a mathematical viewpoint, the noise is slightly autocorrelated
 as the integration process goes below the daily time step.
 We therefore use the expression `random noise' to describe this forcing,
 as opposed to the `seasonal noise' described hereafter.
 To construct the seasonal noise, we add to the random forcing signal a
 lower-frequency component, using a sinusoidal function with a period of
 365 days (Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Seasonal_signal"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 We tune the ratio of low-to-high frequency with the variable 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 so as to keep the same energy content - i.e., equal total variance - in the
 forcing signal.

Note that the upper limit for

 Therefore, total net competition (

 To remove the assumption of an explicit storage effect, we create another
 version of the model using the mean value of a species' growth rate (

 The mean growth rate value is computed by first generating the temperature

c, there were 14 species still present at the end of the simulation forced
 by a random noise, with large disparities in the range of their biomasses.
 A third of the species kept a biomass above 10 kg/area (setting area =
 1 ha, with a depth of a few meters, produces a realistic standing biomasses;
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

) while 6 out of the 14 species biomasses remained below the unit.
 All persisting species in the random noise simulation were clustered within
 a 3.2°C-range of thermal optima (see the biomass distribution as a function
 of the thermal optimum in Electronic Supplementary Material, Fig.
 A1).
 No obvious temporal patterns (e.g., cycles) could be seen in the community
 forced by random noise.
 On the contrary, seasonal cycles were clear in the seasonally-forced case
 of Fig.

d.
 Only 4 species coexisted at the end of the simulation with seasonal noise,
 gathered in two groups with large thermal optimum differences (5.7°C between
 the maximum thermal optimum of the first group and the minimum thermal
 optimum of the second group).
 When temperatures were high, the group with higher thermal optima reached
 its maximum biomass, then as temperature decreases through the season,
 these species leave room for the growth of the low-temperature group.

 In cases where final species richness varied from one simulation to another

: with storage effect but without strong self-regulation, or without storage

 of extant species to, on average, 27% and 48% of their original values,
 respectively (Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Persistence-of-species"

\end_inset

).
 A seasonal signal therefore led to a much smaller average persistence.
 There was also less variance in persistence between seasonally forced simulatio
ns compared to random noise simulations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both a strong self-regulation and the storage effect markedly increased
 persistence.
 Without any of these coexistence mechanisms, only one species persisted
 at the end of the simulations.
 When only the storage effect was present, the number of extant species
 varied between 8 and 20 (14.8 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm$
\end_inset

 2.4) with random noise, or 2 and 6 (4.1 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm$
\end_inset

 0.7) with a seasonal signal.
 On the other hand, when only a strong self-regulation was present, the
 number of extant species nearly doubled, varying between 20 and 32 (27.5
 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm$
\end_inset

 2.4), or 12 and 15 (13.3 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm$
\end_inset

 0.6), with a random or a seasonal noise, respectively.
 Remarkably, when the storage effect and a strong self-regulation both affected
 the community dynamics, all species persisted in the community: the number
 of species coexisting with both mechanisms present is greater than the
 sum of the species coexisting with either mechanism alone.
 The two mechanisms therefore combine superadditively, as their interaction
 has a positive effect on the richness of the community.

The trait-biomass distribution of the community was affected by the type
 of forcing even when the richness of the community was stable (Fig.

).
 Without storage effect nor strong self-regulation, there was only one species
 left at the end of the simulations.
 A random noise favored species with intermediate thermal optima: the final
 species had a thermal optimum between 18.9°C and 21.4°C (only a fourth of
 the initial range of thermal optima) for two simulations out of three and
 the maximum final biomasses over 100 simulations was reached in this range
 (Fig.

 This distribution may indicate a selection for the highest long-term growth
 rates, averaged over time (see scaled growth rates in Fig.

).
 Seasonality with no coexistence mechanisms also led to a single final species
 but, in this case, the species always had a higher maximum growth rate
 (thermal optimum above 22°C).
 Species with a higher thermal optimum were more likely to persist and to
 reach a higher biomass at the end of the simulation.
 38% of the simulations therefore ended with the species having the highest
 temperature optimum, 25°C.
 The shift in trait distribution towards higher maximum growth rates with
 a seasonal noise vs higher average growth rates with a random noise was
 consistent for all model types considered.

When both the storage effect and strong self-regulation were present, the

 The forcing signal modified only the distribution of biomasses, resulting
 in contrasted community structures despite equal richness.
 With a random noise, the distribution was unimodal.
 On the contrary, a seasonal signal led to a bimodal distribution (centered

In cases where the richness of the community varied, the overall shape (multimod
al vs unimodal) of the marginal distribution of extant species with respect
 to the trait axis were similar for both types of environmental forcings
 (Fig.

 By contrast, the type of coexistence mechanism generated different shapes.
 Indeed, the storage effect (when acting alone) led to a multimodal biomass
 distribution with respect to thermal optima.
 We always observed 3 modes with a random noise and 3 modes in 95% of the
 seasonal simulations (Fig.

a).
 With a random noise, extant species were grouped in rather similar clumps
 regarding species thermal optima (between 18.8°C and 22.2°C) whereas species
 tended to be further apart in the seasonal case, covering a total range
 of 7.7°C, with species grouping in the higher part of the thermal range,
 above 22°C.
 On the other hand, strong self-regulation led to a quasi-uniform biomass
 distribution (Fig.

 Species in communities forced by a random noise stayed in the lower range
 of thermal optima (in 96% of the simulations, the highest thermal optimum
 was 22.4°C, see Fig.

 communities subjected to a seasonal fluctuation of their environment, for
 which species with thermal optima above 20.5°C persisted.

 the autocorrelated temperatures enabled them to achieve this highest growth

Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have simulated competitive Lotka-Volterra dynamics forced by a fluctuating
 temperature under a range of scenarios allowing more or less coexistence.
 Two coexistence mechanisms, the storage effect and strong self-regulation
 (i.e., intraspecific competition much stronger than interspecific competition),
 could be either present or absent, which led to four scenarios.
 These four scenarios were crossed with two possibilities for the forcing
 signal, a random noise (mostly white) and a stochastic yet seasonal signal,
 both with equal temporal variance.
 Our investigation therefore built on the model of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "scranton_coexistence_2016"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, which included a random forcing signal and a storage effect, but considered
 seven additional combinations of mechanisms.
 This was motivated by our wish to include two observed features of phytoplankto
n dynamics: seasonal cycles 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "winder_annual_2010,boyce_environmental_2017"

 and strong self-regulation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "chesson_mechanisms_2000,adler_coexistence_2010,barraquand2018coastal"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Many mechanisms can lead to intraspecific competition being stronger than
 interspecific competition: nonlinearities in the functional forms of competitio
n or mutualism that contribute to increasing self-regulation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "kawatsu2018density"

, or predation as well as parasitism (see e.g., the generalist predators in
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

).
 Strong self-regulation seems an ubiquitous feature in competition networks
 of primary producers 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

, and perhaps even more general networks

\begin_layout Standard
Before discussing the ecological interpretation of our results, we first
 recall some technical assumptions made in this study.
 All our simulations lasted for a fixed duration (5000 timesteps) as in
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "scranton_coexistence_2016"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 While short- and medium-term transients (a few years to hundreds of years)
 are completely negligible at the end of the time series, very long transients
 can remain in this class of models 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "scheffer_self-organized_2006,hastings_transient_2018"
literal "false"

\end_inset

: these are not mere artefacts but instead traduce the fact that some processes
 (e.g., exclusion of a species) can be really slow.
 We realized that convergence was incomplete after 5000 years in some cases
 (e.g., random noise + storage effect + equal competitive strength).
 Such simulations would take up to 15 000 years to converge and the rate
 of convergence would slow over time.
 We could have considered longer time intervals, but comparison with the
 values reported by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "scranton_coexistence_2016"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 would then have been compromised.
 Another way to shorten the transients, suggested by a referee (GB), is
 to vary the mortality parameter.
 This did not alter the conclusions (see Appendix B in Electronic Supplementary
 Material).
 Unfortunately, added variability also shifts the model further away from
 neutral dynamics (when intra and interspecific competition strengths are
 equal), which renders comparisons difficult.
 All things considered, we therefore kept the 5000-year time window for
 integration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another strong assumption pertains to competition coefficients.
 To allow for comparison with 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "scranton_coexistence_2016"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, we did not introduce variability in intraspecific competition strength
 or interspecific competition strength.
 By contrast, data-based coefficients vary between species 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "barraquand2018coastal"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, with a majority of weak interactions (as suggested in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "wootton_measurement_2005"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) and more variance in intraspecific coefficients.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "stump_multispecies_2017"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 recently considered the potential effects of competition coefficient variabilit
y (also called non-diffuse competition), as did 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "kokkoris_variability_2002"
literal "false"

\end_inset

; more variance in interspecific competition strength is usually detrimental
 to coexistence for an equal amount of self-regulation (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "stump_multispecies_2017"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 for a classification of the various effects).
 Setting the competition coefficients using a multidimensional trait-based
 framework, like that of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "ashby_competing_2017"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, would provide a natural development to the work presented here; it is
 in our opinion difficult to speculate on those variance effects because
 both intra- and interspecific competition coefficient variances may matter
 to community persistence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, our study is limited to communities whose species have fast population
 dynamics relative to the yearly timescale, like phytoplankton and likely
 other fast-living organisms, so that many generations can occur in a year.
 Persistence in community with slower dynamics may be affected differently
 by seasonality 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "miller_evolutionary_2017"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 This especially true for species with generations that extend over multiple
 years.
 In models where trophic interactions are implemented, seasonality has been
 shown to promote multiyear cycles and the existence of chaotic attractors

LatexCommand citep
key "rinaldi_multiple_1993,taylor_how_2013,tyson_seasonally_2016"

 These rich dynamics of consumers may feed back into the lower trophic levels:
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "dakos_interannual_2009"

\end_inset

 present a planktonic community with seasonally-entrained chaotic dynamics
 which may be partly due to zooplanktonic predation.
 Predation probably entails additional niche differences, possibly with
 an emerging self-regulation created by predation processes 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "chesson_updates_2018"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, but it seems unlikely that we would be able to generate such dynamics
 with the models presented in this article.
 Additional nonlinearities would be needed to create intrinsically variable
 and chaotic dynamics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With these assumptions in mind, we have found that first, temporally forced
 Lotka-Volterra dynamics cannot sustain any diversity with our phytoplankton-bas
ed set of parameters, unless the structure is geared to include either a
 storage effect or a strong self-regulation.
 Although this absence of diversity-enhancing effect of

pure
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 environmental variation has already been stated by other authors 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "chesson_roles_1997,barabas_community_2012,fox_intermediate_2013,scranton_coexistence_2016"

\end_inset

, this is not always intuitive 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "fox_intermediate_2013"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, so we feel compelled to stress it once more: temporal variation in growth
 rate alone cannot help coexistence within competitive communities.
 A nice point made by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "scranton_coexistence_2016"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 was that a built-in storage effect in a forced Lotka-Volterra model, parameteri
zed for phytoplankton communities, could lead to a reasonable degree of
 coexistence.
 Our investigation reproduced these results, using the random noise considered
 by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "scranton_coexistence_2016"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 However, an arguably more lifelike noisy and seasonal temperature forcing
 considerably lessened the richness of the community after 5000 years, decreasin
g from 15 to 4 species on average.
 Even imagining that groups represented here are genera or classes rather
 than species, this is a fairly low diversity for a phytoplankton-like community
 (see e.g., Chapter 1 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "reynolds2006ecology"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 This suggests that the storage effect may not, on its own, be sufficient
 to maintain species-rich communities (e.g., dozens to hundreds of species).
 We have therefore sought out whether a stronger self-regulation could maintain
 a higher diversity, using field-based intra- vs intergroup (species or
 genera) competition strength ratio 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "barraquand2018coastal"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, where the intragroup density-dependence was estimated 10 times stronger.
 Implementing such strong self-regulation, in the forced Lotka-Volterra
 models that we considered, produced a higher level of diversity than the
 storage effect (almost double).
 Of course, the result is somehow contingent upon the strength of self-regulatio
n.
 Our estimates are a little stronger than what was found in perennial plants
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "adler_coexistence_2010"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, where interspecific competition was suggested 4 or 5 times stronger than
 intraspecific.
 Still, the widespread effects of natural enemies in phytoplankton (zooplankton,
 parasites) may contribute to an increase in the self-regulation strength
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "barraquand2018coastal,chesson_updates_2018"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 relative to other systems, hence we believe that 10 times stronger intraspecifi
c competition constitutes a reasonable order of magnitude.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, such strong self-regulation was still insufficient to maintain
 the whole community diversity (60 species) by itself, especially when the
 seasonal forcing was considered (always decreasing species richness).
 The diversity within clumps of similar values of thermal optima was considerabl
y decreased once seasonality was implemented.
 This diversity reduction occurs because within a season, the signal autocorrela
tion gives long, contiguous time intervals to the best competitor to exclude
 its less adapted competitors.
 This makes the results likely to hold not only for seasonal environments,
 but more generally for autocorrelated ones above the daily scale, i.e., 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

red
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 noise.
 In contrast, the random noise scenario – which can be considered white
 noise above the daily temporal scale – generates large temperature shifts
 more frequently, and thereby forbids such competitive exclusion.
 In a seasonal setting, a species with the highest long-term (arithmetically)
 averaged growth rate may not be the best competitor, and can disappear
 as a result of a strong competition from both low- and high-temperature
 tolerant species.
 This holds with or without a storage effect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our results may appear at odds with recent proposals that seasonal forcing
 in itself would help maintain diversity 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "sakavara_lumpy_2018"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 However, we compared the effect of seasonal forcing to that of other forcing
 signals while controlling for total variance.
 Thus, the contrast between our results and those of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "sakavara_lumpy_2018"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 may be due to the role of forcing variance over time: we compare scenarios
 under a constant total variance, much like what is done when examining
 the effect of noise color on population and community dynamics 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "jiang_temperature_2007,ruokolainen_ecological_2009"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Thinking in terms of signal spectrum, while seasonality may maintain slightly
 more diversity than no forcing at all if a storage effect is present, the
 reddening of the environmental noise due to such seasonality reduces coexistenc
e.
 This result may be contingent upon the correlated positive responses of
 the species growth rate to increases in the environmental variable

\begin_layout Standard
The biomass-trait relationship was affected more marginally by the type
 of forcing signal.
 The storage effect alone begot several clumps along the trait space (as
 observed by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "scranton_coexistence_2016"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 The seasonality that we added to the temperature signal led to more distant
 clumps on the trait axis, with less species per clump.
 Conversely, strong self-regulatory mechanisms alone led to relatively uniform
 biomass distributions, with species forming a single large cluster, which
 covered a fraction of the initial trait space.
 Therefore, the shape of the distribution was mostly affected by the coexistence
 mechanism at work while the average trait value was modified by the type
 of environmental forcing, even though the mean value of the environmental
 signal did not change.
 However, when both strong-self regulation and the storage effect were at
 play, the biomass-trait distribution could either be unimodal or multimodal
 depending on the type of noise driving the community dynamics (random or
 seasonal, respectively).
 This implies that the mere observation of multimodality in a thermal preference
 trait-biomass distribution is not a proof of a storage effect, or conversely,
 the proof of the influence of a seasonal environment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The identification of multiple modes in biomass-trait distributions is relativel

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 convincingly argued that multimodality could arise from the demographic
 stochasticity of a single model run.
 However, with several locations - or in a theoretical context as done here
 - one could average across locations.
 Other mechanisms that we did not include in our models may produce similar
 clustered patterns 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 or obfuscate clusters altogether: typically, strong self-regulation weakens
 the clustering on the trait axis.
 Moreover, one should note that the occurrence of clustering is very sensitive
 to the shape of the competition kernel: small differences in shape can
 shift the distribution towards either clustered or uniform 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "pigolotti_how_2010"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Finally, we recall that we focus on a trait (thermal optimum) which clearly
 interacts with the environment: clustering may emerge on another trait
 axis, such as size, which typically affects the competition coefficient,
 without having any relationship to the storage effect 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "segura_emergent_2011,segura_competition_2013,dandrea_translucent_2018,dandrea_generalizing_2019"

 We therefore view clustering on the thermal preference trait axis as an
 interesting clue suggesting to look for a storage effect, rather than any
 definite proof that the storage effect is at work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In our previous empirical study of phytoplankton dynamics 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "barraquand2018coastal"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, we did not find any storage effect.
 This does not mean that it could not be observed in other planktonic systems:
 we studied a coastal ecosystem and focused a specific fraction of phytoplankton
: relatively large diatoms and dinoflagellates.
 However, given the consequences of the storage effect for species richness
 and composition presented here, we are skeptical that the storage effect
 could, by itself, fully explain phytoplankton diversity at any location.
 Our results suggest that in phytoplankton-like seasonal environments, empirical
ly-tuned self-regulation produces much more diversity than the storage effect,
 when both are considered in isolation.
 The storage effect may therefore help phytoplankton diversity maintenance,
 but only when combined to other mechanisms.
 This is all the more likely that in our models, the combination storage
 effect + strong self-regulation is non-additive: the cases where both self-regu
lation and the storage effect were present showed more diversity than generated
 by any mechanism on its own.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above results suggest the very exciting idea that multiple coexistence
 mechanisms might combine superadditively to determine the richness of the
 community, thus helping us to better understand the astounding diversity
 of primary producers.
 This logic could, in principle, be extended to mechanisms that we have
 not considered here (e.g., spatial structure, specialized natural enemies,
 that could be as important here for plankton as they are for tropical trees,
 see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "bagchi_pathogens_2014,comita_testing_2014,barraquand2018coastal"

\end_inset

).
 Superadditivity, i.e.
 the positive effect of interactions between mechanisms can be measured
 either on community diversity, as we did here, or on the invasion growth
 rates 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ellner_expanded_2019"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Using the latter metric, previous research has however demonstrated that
 generalist seed predation could weaken the storage effect 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "kuang_coexistence_2009,kuang_interacting_2010"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 thus different mechanisms might not always combine superadditively as we
 found here.That said, superadditivity has been found in some cases, i.e.,
 pathogens could enhance the storage effect and broaden the conditions in
 which species could coexist 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "mordecai_pathogen_2015"

\end_inset

.
 Better explaining plant or microbial diversity would then not be about
 selecting the best unique mechanism susceptible to explain the observed
 diversity, but rather better combining those mechanisms together.
 This may obviously be an annoyance for those who like to sharpen Occam's
 razor, but it clearly holds opportunities for theoreticians wishing to
 investigate synergies between coexistence mechanisms in highly diverse
 communities.
 Aside from the synergies between predator diversity-enhancing effects,
 strong self-regulation through various means and the storage effect (on
 the temporal axis), one obvious follow-up of this research would be interaction
s with spatial structure.
 Spatial structure occurs both endogeneously, through spatially restricted
 movements and interactions, and exogeneously, through spatial variation
 in environmental covariates

 Moreover, although temperature is usually relatively spatially homogeneous
 over space, other drivers (e.g., rainfall, pH in terrestrial ecosystems;
 salinity in aquatic ones) may exhibit spatial variation which is a main
 factor for coexistence

.
 The odds that different (resource) niches, natural enemies, spatial limits
 to competition and temporal niche partitioning all interact to promote
 the very high-dimensional coexistence observed in the field seem much higher
 than for any of those mechanisms alone.
 Whether the diversity-enhancing effects of these mechanisms combine subadditive
ly (as in
